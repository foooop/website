                There is a hole at the center of everything, and it is always
                growing. Between the stars I am seeing it. It is coming, and you are
                not escaping, and the universe is forgetting you, and the universe
                is being forgotten, and there is nothing to remember it, not even
                the things beyond. And now there is only the hole. You are atoms,
                and your atoms are not caring if you are existing. Your atoms are
                monstrous existence.
