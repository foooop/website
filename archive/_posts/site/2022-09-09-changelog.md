{: .abstract}
A monthly (well, technically daily) changelog page for the website that you're on. Comprehensively lists the little journey that this abode has gone through. <br> <br> Changes/additions/fixes/updates are listed chronologically in reverse. Basically, latest updates first, and oldest updates are buried in the mud. Changelog updates with every commit that includes an addition or fix to the website (unless I forget). 

# 2022
## November 2022

Edited typos.

**22nd.** <br>
Added [Stronger Within](../essays/2022-05-26-stronger-within.md) to works section in me.md.

More updates to easter egg.

**21st.** <br>
Urgent CNAME changes.

Added more content to the index page so that it wouldn't be mostly blank. 

Bumped nokogiri from 1.13.8 to 1.13.9 following a moderate security vulnerability.

Made some minor edits in the first couple sections of me.md. Updated projects section of me.md to include REALISER, an artificial intelligence project that I had worked on for 3 months. I put together some CSS to make this nice-looking glassmorphism card using vanilla-tilt.js.

Changed email address.

Added target="_blank" to all external links.

Also edited this changelog page to include the history of the modern era of this website, which I should have done a long time ago but didn't get around to doing so. Future changelog updates will be included in developments to website.

## October 2022
**20th.** <br>
Change table of contents to Roboto Mono. This is because, for some reason, the numbers on the table of contents wouldn't align vertically if you used a sans-serif font. 

Fixed Github link.

Updated easter egg.

**10th.** <br>
Created CSS variables so that visual development would be more standardised and uniform.

Added a little easter egg.

**9th.** <br>
Spent a couple hours or so trying to tweak the styling and appearance of the site's table of contents. Was evidently frustrated.

Added an abstract element to some pages.

Updated Github workflow so that Github Pages could actually host the website using pre-built files. Commits were made to fix Ruby bundling issues.

**8th.** <br>
Added SEO support.

**7th.** <br>
Resumed development of website following hiatus in January.

I created a new Github account sometime in May. Had to transfer this repository from my old Github account to this one.

Tweaks regarding CNAME and domain hosting.

Updated about.md and internal links to reflect new online persona and accounts.

Did a lot of minor cleaning and polishing. Sometimes you gotta clear the dust and cobwebs off of your repositories.

Added essays: [Stronger Within](../essays/2022-05-26-stronger-within.md). This was one of my essays that featured commentary on social issues in Singapore, and received recognition.

## January 2022
**2nd.** <br>
Very minor edit to about.md.

Was in a bad place during the past few months, and generally lost interest in the development of this website due to personal reasons. This accounts for the following 9-month silence.
