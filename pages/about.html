                <h2>Glad you asked! I'm <span style="font-size: 36px;">Weiyi Ma.</span></h2>
                <p>As of 2021, I am a 14-year-old high school student residing in Singapore.</p>
                <p>I possess an ardent enthusiasm in <span style="color: red;">programming, mathematics, and science,</span> accompanied with a moderate enjoyment of <span style="color: red;">music</span> and <span style="color: red;">language arts.</span> Like any other teenager, I browse social media in my free time.</p>
                <p>In recent times, I've surrounded myself in all things STEM. Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, maybe even sprinkle in some art. In the midst of all this chaos and confusion, I've found comfort in building <span style="color: red;">websites</span> (like this one), <span style="color: red;">Discord bots</span>, general programs to help me with calculations, and other things that bring me satisfaction when they work.</p>
                <p>Of course, not to say that everything I've interacted has something to do with pure STEM. I've been researching about <span style="color: red;">social interactions, environments, and even traffic management</span> to see how artificial intelligence can tie in more into our ordinary lives.</p>
                <p>On the more experimental side, I'm learning about <span style="color: red;">quantum computing</span>, <span style="color: red;">augmented reality</span>, and <span style="color: red;">Unity game development</span>.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 id="you" class="right">what's your education like?</h1>
                <p>Not to go into many details, but I began my education journey at <a href="http://www.shalombpchurch.org/wp/?page_id=2091">Shalom Kindergarten</a>, graduated, got enrolled into <a href="https://casuarinapri.moe.edu.sg/">Casuarina Primary School</a>, and graduated.</p>
                <p>I now study at <a href="https://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/">Dunman High School</a> as a Secondary Two student. My main CCA is STEAM Collective (Infocomm) and my 2nd CCA is Oratorical Society (Debates).</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 id="you" class="right">what skills do you have?</h1>
                <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
                <p>I am most proficient in HTML, CSS <span style="font-size: 12px;">(not programming languages)</span>, JavaScript (Node.js, discord.js), and Python 3.</p>
                <p>I have around 300+ training hours in front-end development, 310+ training hours in Python, 150+ training hours in Javascript, and around 100+ training hours in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                <p>I have little experience coding with C++, C# (Unity), Ruby, Swift, React, Helmet.js, CoffeeScript, Svelte, HAML, SASS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, socket.py, discord.py, micro:bit, Arduino, and Qiskit.</p>
